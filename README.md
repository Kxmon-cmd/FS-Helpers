# FS-Helpers

This repository includes some helpful Python code for compatibility of Quantum ESPRESSO with FitSNAP as well as some code for visualising results. Included are two programs for converting MD output to XYZ or JSON files, making it possible to use as input for FitSNAP. Another program can be used to plot predicted energies/forces against the reference energies/forces provided a FITSNAP.df dataframe. The 2bterm.py can be used to visualise the two-body term of an ACE potential.

Note that for PlotParity.py, a FitSNAP installation is required.
